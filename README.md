# High-Efficiency-Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracking-Development-using-Arduino

Abstract- 
The renewable-energy sector is fast gaining ground as a new growth area for numerous countries with the vast potential it presents environmentally and economically. Solar energy plays an important role as a primary source of energy, especially for rural area. This paper presents the design and development of high-efficiency dual-axis solar tracking system using Arduino platform. Furthermore, the ultimate objective of this project is to trace the maximum sunlight source to power the solar panel. The project is divided into two stages, which are hardware and software development. In hardware development, five light dependent resistor (LDR) has been used for capturing maximum light source. Two servo motors have been used to
move the solar panel at maximum light source location sensing by
LDR. Moreover, the code is constructed using C programming language and targeted to Arduino UNO controller. The efficiency of the system has been tested and compared with static solar panel on several time intervals, and it shows the system react the best at the to-minutes intervals with consistent voltage generated. Therefore, the system has been proven working for capturing the maximum sunlight source for high efficiency solar harvesting applications.

INTRODUCTION

Nowadays, climate change on globe is at a critical level. Climate change can be divided into two categories, human and natural causes. Natural causes of climate changes are ocean current, solar variations, and earth orbital changes. The main parts of climate changes caused by human are man-made greenhouse gases. Global warming or climate changes can be seen through some of them natural phenomenon like the effect on crops and extreme weather conditions around the world.
Renewable-energy is an energy which comes from natural resources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, and geothermal heat, which are renewable (naturally replenished). Renewable-energy is the best growing energy source on the globe. Renewable energy is a source of energy that doesn't consume the finite resources of the earth and can be easily and quickly replenished. Renewable-energy plays a key role in a country's energy needs; enabling businesses to gather energy cost investments and also revenue thus control the outcome of climate changes. In Malaysia, oil and coal are the primary resources of electrical energy for relatively long periods of time. Knowing that oil and coal will be reduced, the government had started to decrease the usage of oil and coal as the main energy resources of electrical energy and started an initiative of using another renewable-energy such as solar and hydro. In Malaysia, the residential energy use accounts for more than 14,365 GWh or 19% of total electricity consumed in Peninsular Malaysia in year 2006. Demand of electricity keeps increasing by years, solar energy is the alternative for those electricity problems.
Solar energy is the energy derived from the sun through the form of solar radiation. The sun is the most inexhaustible, renewable source of energy known to man. Solar energy provides light, heat and energy to all living things. There is no price and also no air pollution created by solar energy, environmentally friendly and the solar energies are interminable supplies. The developments of the solar tracker are applied in this particular project because Malaysia's climate is categorized as equatorial, being hot and humid throughout the year. As for solar energy, it is pertinent that it has a lot of advantages and disadvantages when it comes to compare other energy sources. The fundamental issue of utilizing solar energy is not a matter of lack of other sources of energy but it is a matter of environmental concern as some conventional energy sources contribute high emissions to the environments.
